  ###pleeease compile

  The first command is `compile`

  For example, compile `"foo.css"` to `"bar.css"`:

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile foo.css to bar.css
  ```

  **It's just easy as that!**

  You can compile more files at the same time. Here `"foo.css"` and `"bar.css"` will be concatenated to `"baz.css"`:

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile foo.css bar.css to baz.css
  ```

  You can also compile an entire folder, and copy the result file to another destination (if folders don't exist, they will be created):

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile css/ to public/css/app.min.css
  ```

  ###pleeease watch

  Last command but not least: `watch`. This command is the same as the `compile` one, except that the live compilation is activated. When a modification is detected, **files will be recompiled automatically**.

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease watch foo.css to bar.css
  ```

  ###defaults

  *Pleeease* is configured this way:

    * input is `"*.css"`
    * output is `"app.min.css"`

  It means that you are not forced to use the long form syntax. For example:

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile
  ```

  is the same as:

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile *.css to app.min.css
  ```

  In the same way:

  ```javascript
  $ pleeease compile styles/foo.css
  ```

  compile `"styles.css/foo.css"` to `"app.min.css"`

  You can [override default values with a configuration file](#configuration-file).
