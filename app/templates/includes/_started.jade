	##Get started

	The simplest way to use *Pleeease* is [CLI](cli.html) (command-line interface).

	First, you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that comes with `npm`, its module manager. Then, install *Pleeease* globally on your system:

	```javascript
	$ npm install -g pleeease
	```

	**And that's all!** You're ready to learn [how to use it](#how-it-works).
